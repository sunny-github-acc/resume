## About The Project

This project is a creative and unconventional take on a traditional resume. Instead of a static PDF, it's a fully interactive command-line interface where visitors can type commands to learn about my skills, projects, and experience.

It was built as a fun way to showcase my technical abilities and personality, inspired by a job application for a company that values standing out.
